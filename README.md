# Learn music production by building audio plugin

A tutorial for newbie who ask how I started learning Audio programming. Frankly, I found striking tough as someone hasn't got prior exposure to music.
Let us kick start the journey of developing VST, VST3, AU, AAX plugins using C++ and JUCE

0. Learn Daws, C++

1. Learn JUCE

Once you feel comfortable writing basic programs in C++, you can move on to developing plugins with C++. You'll use a framework like JUCE to do this; this is the leading framework for multi-platform audio applications.

JUCE allows you to create music applications for macOS, iOS, Windows, Android, and Linux using the same source code. You can also use it to compile VST, VST3, RTAS, AU, and AAX plugins as well as create slick user interfaces.

2. Create Your Own Audio Effects and Software Synthesizers

Once you’ve worked your way through the recommended courses, there are a handful of popular textbooks that can help take your understanding of plugin development to the next level:

* Designing Audio Effect Plugins in C++

* Designing Software Synthesizer Plugins in C++

* A Digital Signal Processing Primer: with Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music

It’s going to take quite a while to work your way through all of this content but you should know how to make audio plugins by the time you're finished.

Similar to producing music, programming is something that you can continuously improve upon over time. If you enjoy the process of learning, you'll love developing plugins.
